        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
        <li>3⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>¼ cup tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>¼ cup sliced black olives</li>
        <li>¼ cup roasted red peppers</li>

        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
    </ul>

    <ul><b>Directions:</b>
        <li><b>Step 1</b>
            <p>
                Pour warm water into a large bowl; dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until yeast softens
                and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 10 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Step 2</b>
            <p>
                HMix in flour, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Turn
                onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth, about 8 minutes. Place dough in a well-oiled bowl
                and cover with a damp cloth. Set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down; knead in garlic
                and basil. Set aside to rise for 1 more hour, or until doubled again.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Step 3</b>
            <p>
                Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. Combine 1/2 cup olive oil with minced garlic in a microwave-safe
                cup or bowl. Heat for 30 seconds in the microwave; set aside.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Step 4</b>
            <p>
                Punch down dough and divide in half. Form each half into an oblong shape 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Step 5</b>
            <p>
                Brush grill grate with garlic-flavored olive oil. Carefully place one piece of dough on the hot grill.
                Dough will begin to puff almost immediately. When the bottom crust has lightly browned, turn dough over
                using two spatulas. Working quickly, brush oil over crust, and then brush with 2 tablespoons tomato
                sauce. Arrange 1/2 cup chopped tomatoes, 1/8 cup sliced black olives, and 1/8 cup roasted red peppers
                over crust. Sprinkle with 1 cup cheese and 2 tablespoons basil. Close the lid, and cook until cheese
                melts. Remove from grill and set aside to cool for a few minutes. Repeat with second piece of dough.
