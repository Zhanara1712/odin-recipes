    <ul><b>Directions:</b>
        <li><b>Step 1</b>
            <p>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper
                muffin liners.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Step 2</b>
            <p>
                Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in sausage and cook until crumbly, evenly browned, and
                no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain off grease.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Step 3</b>
            <p>
                Beat eggs in a large bowl. Stir in onion, green pepper, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Mix in sausage
                and Cheddar cheese. Spoon into the prepared muffin cups.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Step 4</b>
            <p>
                Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
